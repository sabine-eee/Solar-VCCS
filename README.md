Solar array 24x42cm with approx 40vDC battery

make circut combo that's able to charge internal battery 

materials needed: 
1. Relevant light irradiation graphs for a 24hr basis
2. thermals of circut over time based on weather

considered components/ideas: 
VCCS with some diodes for current controls in case of over-current-ing
Ability to switch from charging battery mode to making sure the components are able to run straight from it
^ above condition can only work if sollar array can produce appropriate voltage for system



week 1 goal: 
templates for simulation and general diagram for components usage

week 2-3 goal: 
make/test circut on standard board 
be on your way to final design

week 4-5 goal:
order tester board
test on tester board
